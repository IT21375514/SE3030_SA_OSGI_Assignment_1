**Job & Training Exchange Platform**


**Overview**

The Job & Training Exchange Platform is a comprehensive system designed to facilitate interactions among companies, job seekers, job trainers, and training seekers. Leveraging the power of the OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) framework, this platform offers a dynamic and modular architecture to efficiently manage and deliver various services.

**Components**

1. Company Producer-Consumer: Allows companies to interact with job seekers and other individuals. Companies can add information, manage their profiles, post job listings, and communicate seamlessly with job seekers.

2. Job Seeker Producer-Consumer: Provides a platform for individuals to interact with job opportunities. Job seekers can input their demographic information, manage their profiles, and access job listings provided by companies.

3. Job Trainer Producer-Consumer: Facilitates interactions between individuals seeking training services and companies offering training programs. Job trainers can input their information, access registered company information, and provide training services.

4. Training Seeker Producer-Consumer: Enables individuals to interact with job trainers and find relevant training programs. Training seekers can input their information, manage their profiles, and search for trainers based on their training requirements.

**Integration with OSGi**

The platform utilizes the dynamic service communication capabilities of the OSGi framework to facilitate seamless interactions between Producer-Consumers. This integration ensures efficient communication and data exchange, enhancing the user experience for both providers and consumers of services.

**How to Use**

To use the platform, users can access the respective Producer-Consumers based on their roles and requirements. Companies can interact with the Company Producer-Consumer to manage their profiles and post job listings, while job seekers can access the Job Seeker Producer-Consumer to browse and apply for job opportunities.
